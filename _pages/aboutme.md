title: "About Me"
---
 I am an Assistant Clinical Professor in the Department of Computer Science, where I primarily [teach](/teaching/) core foundational programming and computer systems courses in the [Masters Program in Computer Science](/mpcs/) but I am also fortunate to teach classes in the [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](http://capp.cs.uchicago.edu) Program. I am also Associate Director of the Masters Program in Computer Science (MPCS), where my main responsibility is help advise students about the courses offered in the MPCS program.  

I am originally from Las Vegas, NV. However, after graduating from high school I moved to the wonderful college town of San Luis Obispo, CA. I majored in computer science and decided to move to Chicago to earn my PhD. I earned my PhD in 2016 from the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago, where I was advised by John Reppy. My dissertation focused creating a programming language for implementing declaractive computer graphics applications using Functional Reactive Programming.

Here are a few tidbits about myself:

- Hiking and running (not much hiking in Chicago) but running down the lakefront is amazing.

- I am the dad of a wonderful and sweet lab/terrier dog named Finn. [<img src="/images/finn.jpg" width="250"/>](/images/finn.jpg)

- Listening to music and discovering new music (thanks Spotify) are hobbies I can't live without. I also like going to local shows. Chicago has so many amazing theather houses but I especailly enjoy the shows at Steppenwolf.

- One of reasons I decided to get my PhD is that I love learning about new technologies in computer science. I think I'm lucky to be part of a profession that is continuously expanding, generating new ideas and changing the lives of everyone. Thus, I really enjoy buying new books to expand on my knowledge on my profession.

- Screaming at the TV while watching Tennis. I'm a huge tennis fanatic!

- I really enjoy cooking and improving on my culinary skills.
