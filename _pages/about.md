Since July 2018, I have been an Assistant Clinical Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I primarily [teach](/teaching/) foundational programming and computer systems' courses in the [Masters Program in Computer Science](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu) but I am also fortunate enough to teach classes in the wonderful [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](http://capp.cs.uchicago.edu) program. 

I am also Associate Director of the Masters Program in Computer Science (MPCS), where my main responsibility is help advise students about the courses offered in the MPCS program. If you would like to learn more about MPCS then please visit our [website](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu).

I earned a PhD in 2016 from the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago, where I was advised by John Reppy. My dissertation focused creating a programming language for implementing declaractive computer graphics applications using Functional Reactive Programming. Currently, I am not actively involved in research, however, my reasearch interests in past have revolved programming languages, compilers, concurrency, and GPGPUs.
